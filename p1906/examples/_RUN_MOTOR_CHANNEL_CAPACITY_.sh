# Microtubule orientation is governed in 3D space via spherical coordinates, orientationPhi and orientationTheta. 
# Microtubule rigidity is controlled vi a persistence length argument. 
# A motor is injected at the origin and can bind and walk along microtubules to guide its motion. 
# In this example we hold persistence length constant and modify the orientation of the MTs in radians and can simulate the impact on motor propagation time.
# The results are stored in Mathematica files that can be Import[]'ed to display the microtubules and motor motion.
