 *
 * \brief Base class implementing P1906 metrics
 *
 * This class implements persistence length as described in:
 *	  Bush, S. F., & Goel, S. (2013). Persistence Length as a Metric for Modeling and 
 *	    Simulation of Nanoscale Communication Networks, 31(12), 815-824. 
 *		http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130014.
 *	  
 * The Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) is required for these methods.
 *  All points and positions are in three dimensions comprised of a gsl_vector * of length three (x, y, z).
 *  All lines and segments are comprised of two points within a gsl_vector * of length size (x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2).
 *  Lists of points or positions are in a gsl_matrix * of size n x 3.
 *  Each tube is comprised of a list of segments within a gsl_matrix * of size s x 6 -> s x ((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)).
 *  A set of tubes is also a gsl_matrix * of size (s * t) x 6, where s is the number of segments and t the number of tubes.
 *  All random number are derived from gsl_rng *.

 * a)	Specificity
 * b)	Affinity
